# hlc.h

Inspired by [Nobuild project](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuil) created by [Alexey Kutepov](https://github.com/rexim/) and released under MIT license.\
I took some concepts from it and adapted for my cases.\
This library is created to be used in personal projects.\
Work in progress

# Using

`hlc.h` is header only [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) style library.
The only thing you need is a copy of `hlc.h`.

```c
#define HLC_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "hlc.h"
```

# Examples

You can find few code examples directly in [hlc.h](https://github.com/xndrg/hlc.h/blob/main/hlc.h).
