# hlc.h

Inspired by Nobuild project created by Alexey Kutepov and released under MIT license.\
https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild\
I took some concepts from it and adapted for my cases.
This library is created to be used in personal projects.
Work in progress

# Using

`hlc.h` is header only stb style library.
The only thing you need is a copy of `hlc.h`.

```c
#define HLC_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "hlc.h"
```

# Examples

You can find few code examples (not much) directly in [hlc.h](https://github.com/xndrg/hlc.h/blob/main/hlc.h).
